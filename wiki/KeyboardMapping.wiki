= Xmodmap Keyboard Layout File Syntax =

General syntax of the xmodmap keyboard layout file is described in the [http://www.linuxmanpages.com/man1/xmodmap.1x.php xmodmap(1x)] manual page. For the purposes of keyboard switching implementation in directvnc, the following subset of its syntax is used:

  * Comments (linets starting with an exclamation mark) are recognized as such, and ignored
  * Expressions using _keycode_ are recognized with up to four keysym values, used as described in the mentioned manual page.

So, the following is a valid syntax of an xmodmap file that can be converted into a directvnc keyboard layout file:
